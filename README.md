## Overview

In Spark, conversations take place in virtual meeting rooms. Spark allows conversations to flow seamlessly between messages, video calls and real-time whiteboarding sessions. No other solution brings together so many facets of collaboration into a single unified platform.  [Download the Cisco Spark client app](https://www.ciscospark.com/downloads.html) for any device.

Alternatively, view the [Quick Reference](https://developer.ciscospark.com/quick-reference.html) page to learn more about what is possible using Spark APIs.

###### But wait, there's more!
Spark also provides the ability to create Spark Bots that can automate routine tasks and inject contextual content into meetings and group conversations.

## Creating a Spark Bot

Once you have created an account on [developer.ciscospark.com](developer.ciscospark.com):

- Navigate to [My Apps](https://developer.ciscospark.com/apps.html) on the Spark developer portal
- Click on the plus sign in the upper right
- Select `Create a Bot`
- Enter in the basic information: e.g. the bot's display name, Spark username, and icon url
- Once ready, select `Add Bot`

**Note:**

`After creating a new bot, the bot's Access Token will only be displayed once.`
`Make sure to scroll down on the confirmation page, copy the token and keep it somewhere safe` 
`If you misplace it, you can always generate a new one by finding the bot in My Apps and selecting "Regenerate Access Token" from the edit page.`
